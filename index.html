            <p>Originally, Circible was a 2 month project that focused on spreading the word of God to those in the community by providing daily Bible verses that were applicable to what was going on in the World. Due to this, I myself have gotten closer to the Lord while also having the oppurtunity to bring others closer. The donation page will still be up as well as the Circidle game. Thank you to everyone that participated.</p>
